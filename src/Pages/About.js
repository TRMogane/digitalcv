                I have previous work experience as a direct sales agent. My exposure with SAP ERP system started with my promotion to head 
                cashier where I used SAP Material Management to manage stock. My understanding of basic System testing started when I worked
                 as sales support for Telkom. Part of my duties were working on CMSS for back-office support, CRM end-user testing before system 
                 is deployed to direct stores, Testing user manuals (BPIs) and offering CRM system training to agents.
                 My Passion for System analysis has grown due to projects I have worked on during my school career.

                 It is my believe that a good Business analyst can assist an organization in choosing the right software and business process/practices
                  that will allow any organization to fast-track their processes and keep track of financial operations.
